The dataset is about events of death event as categorical variable(classifier)
Since my variable of inteserest is survival, I have transformed the variable as survival (1 - Death)
I have tried both univariate approach and stepwise regression method to fit the model
In both approach, I have found **** as the significant variable
Regression method: Binomial Logistic Regression (Since the outcome has only two catogory)
